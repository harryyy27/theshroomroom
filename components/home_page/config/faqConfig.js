        question: "How do I prepare dried mushrooms?",
        answer:"Preparing dried mushrooms has been a source of discontent from me. Submerging them in water seems to do the trick. However, you will lose nutrients to the water via diffusion.. so what can you do? Well part of the idea of using these mushrooms is the nutrients so losing them doesn't really seem like an option. So you can either 1) use the mushrooms dry as either a seasoning or in a tea or stew. You could also add them to watery sauces and allow them to soak up the moisture. Or 2) You can soak presoak them and use the leftover nutrient broth on something that will absorb it. So you use it for something like boiling rice or making gravy."

        question: "How do I cook these mushrooms?",
        answer:"Lion's mane like all other edible mushrooms contain a molecule called chitin in their cell wall. This is undigestible and locks away a lot of the nutrients that you are trying to benefit from. Luckily for us, this cell wall can be broken down by heating it. I prefer frying these mushrooms. However, boiling them will also work. It is a matter of preference. As long as you heat them, you'll be doing what you need to."

        question: "How long can I store them for?",
        answer:"From picking these mushrooms fresh, they should last approximately 7 days. However, dried they can last for years as long as they are stored properly in sealable packaging or an airtight jar in a cool / dry place."
