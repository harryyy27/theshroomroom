        question: "How do I prepare dried mushrooms?",
        answer:"Submerging them in water seems to do the trick. However, you may lose some nutrients to the water via diffusion.. so what can you do? Well part of the idea of using these mushrooms is the nutrients so losing them doesn't really seem like an option. So you can either 1) use the mushrooms dry as either a seasoning, in a tea or in a stew. You could also add them to watery sauces and allow them to soak up the moisture as well as flavour. Or 2) You can soak them and use the leftover nutrient broth on something that will absorb it. So using it for something like boiling rice or making gravy. Alternatively, you can just buy them fresh."

        question: "How do I cook these mushrooms?",
        answer:"Lion's mane like all other edible mushrooms contain a molecule called chitin in their cell wall. This is undigestible and locks away a lot of the precious nutrients that you are trying to benefit from. Luckily for us, this cell wall can be broken down by heating it. I prefer frying these mushrooms. However, boiling them will also work. It is a matter of preference. As long as you heat them, you'll be doing what you need to."

        question: "How long can I store them for?",
        answer:"Fresh mushrooms last approximately approximately 7 days from being picked. However, dried they can last for years as long as they are stored properly in sealable packaging or an airtight jar in a cool / dry place. They must however remain dry. The low water potential of dried mushrooms leads to absorption of water vapour. This is because mushrooms have high osmotic potential."
