        question: "How do I prepare dried mushrooms?",
        answer:"We like adding dried mushrooms to watery sauces or stews so the mushrooms absorb all of those delicious flavours while they are cooking. When the mushrooms are ground, they make a great seasoning. You can also restore them back to their former glory by submerging them in water. Some of the nutrients will diffuse into the water which can then be used in a tea, stew or gravy."

    {
        question: "How do I cook these mushrooms?",
        answer:"Heat to eat! Lion's mane like all other edible mushrooms contain a molecule called chitin in their cell wall. This seals away a lot of the precious nutrients that you are trying to benefit from. Luckily for us, this cell wall can be broken down by heating it. I prefer frying these mushrooms. However, boiling them will also work. It is a matter of preference. As long as you heat them, you'll be doing what you need to."
    },
    {
        question: "How long can I store them for?",
        answer:"Fresh mushrooms last approximately 7 days from being picked. However, dried they can last for years as long as they are stored properly in sealable packaging or an airtight jar in a cool / dry place. They must however remain dry. The low water potential of dried mushrooms leads to absorption of water vapour."
