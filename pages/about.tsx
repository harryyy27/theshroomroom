            <p>We are a business that grow mushrooms in a controlled and sterile environment in accordance with Great Britain's organic farming standards.</p>
            <p>The aim of the game is to bring healthy, tasty and difficult to acquire mushrooms to British cuisine and to help other mushroom farmers and mycologists with their growing goals.</p>
            <p>We also like to learn, discover and educate ourselves and research the field of mycology, to unlock its secrets and bring value from them.</p>
            <p>Our journey starts here.</p>
