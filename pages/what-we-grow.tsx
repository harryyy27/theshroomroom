            <h1>What we grow</h1>
            <p>For now, we are only growing lion's mane mushrooms. We are currently not working with a lot of space and in order to optimise growing conditions, we decided to commit to the temperature and humidity requirements of 1 type of mushroom rather than work with averages, which inevitably leads to an inferior product and slower growth process. However, we will soon be renting out a warehouse which should give us the space we need to grow a broad range of mushrooms for your consumption. Stay tuned!</p>
